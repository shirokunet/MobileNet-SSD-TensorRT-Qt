I replaced depthwise with group_conv,because group_conv  has been optimized in cudnn7

I retrianed mobileNet-SSD,my number of classfication is 5

**TODO:**

- [x] To save serialized model 
- [x] To solve the bug of getting different result with same input
- [ ] The bottleneck of time cost lies in the decoding of pictures. "imread" cost too much ,to resolve it.
- [ ] To modify the architecture, decrease the time cost
